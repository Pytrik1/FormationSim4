FormationSim4 is a package to simulate N Nexus robots with conctrollers and dataprocessing nodes that detect n agents rather than being fixed to a square formation

this git repository should be cloned in your "catkin_ws/src" folder, you will also need some components from the "nexus" folder from the DTPA Lab and the "Hector_sensors_description" folder which can be found in the following website: "https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_models" (maybe some other general gazebo packages to run the sensors) 

The purpose of these scripts is to simulate a formation of 4 nexus robots DISTRIBUTEDLY controlled using rplidar.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOLDERS:

lasmultidescription4 -- this folder includes launch files for rviz, and urdf files that determine the shapes of the robots and specs of the lidar scanner

lasmultigazebo4 -- this folder contains the gazebo launch files

lasmulticontrol4 -- this folder contains the controllers that make the robots go into formation

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN THE GAZEBO SIMULATION:

in "lasmultigazebo4/launch"

roslaunch N_nexus_world.launch

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO START THE FORMATION CONTROL:

in "lasmultigazebo4/launch" run the following commands in order in the terminal

roslaunch data_processing.launch

roslaunch control_decentralised.launch

HOW TO START THE PATH PLANNER:

in "lasmultigazebo4/launch", run the following command
