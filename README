FormationSim4 is a package to simulate N Nexus robots with conctrollers and dataprocessing nodes that detect n agents rather than being fixed to a square formation

"lasmulticontrol" should be placed in your "catkin_ws/src" folder, you will also need some components from the "nexus" folder from the DTPA Lab and the "Hector_sensors_description" folder which can be found in the following website: "https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_models" (maybe some other general gazebo packages to run the sensors) 

The purpose of these scripts is to simulate a formation of 4 nexus robots DISTRIBUTEDLY controlled using rplidar.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOLDERS:

lasmultidescription -- this folder includes launch files for rviz, and urdf files that determine the shapes of the robots and specs of the lidar scanner

lasmultigazebo -- this folder includes the gazebo launch files

lasmulticontrol -- this folder includes the controllers that make the robots go into formation

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN THE GAZEBO SIMULATION:

in "lasmultigazebo/launch"

roslaunch nexus_world.launch

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO START THE FORMATION CONTROL:

in "lasmulticontrol4" run the following commands in order in the terminal

./dataprocessing_nexus

./controllers_nexus
